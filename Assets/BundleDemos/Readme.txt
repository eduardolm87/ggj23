Hi! Thank you for downloading this short demo of "Dialogue System + Feel + Text Animator" bundle!

You can easily see how we've set up an example of all the three assets working together, including:
- A simple dialogue with branching options
- Animations of talking characters synced with the dialogue, both to models and text (waving, shaking ...)
- Effects (camera zoom, shake, ...) synced with the typewriter

REQUIREMENTS:
